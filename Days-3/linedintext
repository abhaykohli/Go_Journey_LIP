Stop Copy-Pasting your Code. Use Go Generics. 🚀

Body: For the longest time, Go developers had a dilemma. If you wanted a Linked List for int and a Linked List for string, you had two choices:

Copy-paste the struct (Violating DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself).

Use interface{} (Violating Type Safety).

Go 1.18 changed everything with Generics.

For Day 3 of my #GoLearningJourney, I broke down how to create reusable, type-safe code using Type Parameters.

📘 Inside the attached guide: 🔹 The Syntax: How to read [T any] (it's just a placeholder!). 🔹 The "Comparable" Rule: Why you can't just == generic values without asking permission. 🔹 The Stringer Pattern: How to write a function that accepts any struct, as long as it has a .String() method. 🔹 Generic Structs: Creating a Linked List that works for Strings, Ints, or Users.

💡 Quick Fact: Go uses "Monomorphization" for Generics. This means the compiler generates a specific version of your function for every concrete type you use (one for int, one for string). The result? Zero runtime performance penalty. 🚀
