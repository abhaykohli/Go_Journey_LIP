Headline: Forget Classes. Master Go Structs. 🏗️

Body: If you are coming from Java or Python, you might be looking for class, extends, or super. Go doesn't have them.

Instead, Go gives you Structs. They are simple, lightweight, and surprisingly powerful.

For Day 5 of my #GoLearningJourney, I’m creating the ultimate guide to Data Modeling in Go.

Inside the attached guide: 🔹 The Basics: Defining and Initializing data. 🔹 The Pointer Shortcut: Why (*p).X is ugly and p.X is beautiful. 🔹 Composition: How to embed one struct into another (Go's answer to inheritance). 🔹 Tags: How to control your JSON output with simple backticks.

The Philosophy: Go prefers Composition over Inheritance. Instead of building deep, complex family trees of classes, you build small, simple Lego blocks (Structs) and snap them together.
